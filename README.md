# Machine_learning-ML-

This is a repository showcasing my most important Python machine learning projects.

Specifically in this repository I show how I am:

* Proficient in selecting and implementing appropriate machine learning algorithms for different types of problems.
* Skilled in performing feature selection and engineering to create new variables or transform existing ones.
* Knowledgeable in creating visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships of input and output variables.
* Competent in identifying and analyzing correlations between input and output variables.
* Able to communicate insights and findings effectively through visualizations and/or reports.

And when it comes to Python libraries, I show my ability in the following:

* NumPy: a library for scientific computing with support for arrays and matrices.
* Pandas: a library for data manipulation and analysis.
* Matplotlib: a library for creating visualizations, such as line charts, scatter plots, and histograms.
* Seaborn: a library for creating more advanced and aesthetically pleasing visualizations, such as heatmaps and pair plots.
* Plotly: a library for creating interactive visualizations, such as maps and 3D plots.
* Scikit-learn: a library for machine learning with support for classification, regression, and clustering algorithms.
* Keras: a library for building neural networks and deep learning models.
* TensorFlow: an open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks.
